# Tyrian counter example built with Mill

This is a minimal working project setup to run the counter example.

The instructions on running below will do a compile of the mill project, but you can do it manually with:

```sh
mill counter.buildSite
```

To run the program in a browser you will need to have yarn (or npm) installed.

On first run:

```sh
yarn install
```

and from then on

```sh
yarn start
```
